I am eager to bring my technical knowledge and analytical skills to the field as an entry-level data analyst or data scientist.

During my studies and projects, I have gained experience in working with diverse datasets, data visualization, and statistical analysis. My IT background has also equipped me with skills in database management, programming, and leveraging tools like Python, Java, SQL and Excel to solve complex challenges. I am enthusiastic about applying these skills to real-world problems and creating impactful solutions.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. I am driven by the excitement of discovering patterns and trends in data and the opportunity to use these insights to solve challenging problems, whether collaborating in a team or working independently.

This repository serves as a platform to showcase my skills, share projects, and document my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.
