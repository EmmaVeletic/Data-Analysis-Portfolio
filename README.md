# Emma VeletiÄ‡ - Data Analysis Portfolio

## About

Hi, I'm Emma! With a background in Information Technology and a passion for data-driven decision-making, I am currently on a journey to deepen my expertise in Data Analytics and Data Science. I have developed a strong foundation in IT principles and problem-solving, which complements my interest in uncovering meaningful insights through data. I am eager to bring my technical knowledge and analytical skills to the field as an entry-level data analyst or data scientist.

During my studies and projects, I have gained experience in working with diverse datasets, data visualization, and statistical analysis. My IT background has also equipped me with skills in database management, programming, and leveraging tools like Python, Java, SQL and Excel to solve complex challenges. I am enthusiastic about applying these skills to real-world problems and creating impactful solutions.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. I am driven by the excitement of discovering patterns and trends in data and the opportunity to use these insights to solve challenging problems, whether collaborating in a team or working independently.

This repository serves as a platform to showcase my skills, share projects, and document my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.

## Projects

In this section, I will outline my data analytics projects, summarizing the tech stack applied to solve the problems.

### Coffe Shop Exploration

Code: [Coffe Shop Project](https://github.com/EmmaVeletic/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/Coffe%20shop.sql)

Dataset Used: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/viramatv/coffee-shop-data

- Coffee Shop Sales/Inventory/Staff

Description: The dataset contains records of managing coffee shop like sales, inventory, staff, shifts etc. This project includes the following steps: data loading, data preprocessing (cleaning, transformation and reduction) and EDA (exploratory data analysis).

Skills: Joins, Aggregate Functions, Converting Data Types, Windows Functions, Extract date, Case Expression, Creating Views

Technology: PostgreSQL

### Car Price Analyze

Code: [Car Price Analyze](https://github.com/EmmaVeletic/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/Car_price.sql)

Dataset Used: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asinow/car-price-dataset

- Car Price Dataset

Description: This dataset contains informations over 10,000 cars. This project involves analyzing a dataset of car prices to understand market trends and identify key factors influencing price - mostly exploratory data analysis. The overall goal is to gain insights into car pricing dynamics and market segmentation using SQL.

Skills used: Windows Functions, Creating Views, Using CTE tables, Aggregate Functions, Converting Data Types, Case Expression

Technology: PostgreSQL


### Analyzing salary in IT industry

Spreadsheet: https://1drv.ms/x/c/825f331c95e8f658/Eat5u8uj39pJhJqN9ebQmLkBFDknDewC2vxz4lVc3A3Ovg?e=tFB42U

Dataset Used - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amirmahdiabbootalebi/salary-by-job-title-and-country

- The project utilizes Salary by Job Title and Country.

Description: This Excel project involves creating a comprehensive dashboard for salaries in IT industry, utilizing data cleaning, pivot tables, and visualizations. The goal is to provide a user-friendly dashboard where users can interact with the data, exploring salary insights based on various factors.

Key Steps in the Project:
1. Data Cleaning: Identify and remove duplicates, standardize categorical data (e.g.,education level, years of experience).
2. Create Working Sheet: Copy raw data to a working sheet for manipulation, keeping the original data intact.
3. Pivot Tables: Utilize pivot tables to summarize and analyze data for visualization.
4. Visualizations: Build visualizations using recommended charts to represent key insights, such as average income, representation of individual job titles, and age buckets.
5. Dashboard Creation: Copy visualizations in to a dashboard sheet for a consolidated view.
6. Chart Customization: Adjust chart titles, axis labels, and formatting for better clarity.


Skills: data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization.

Technology: Excel.

Results: 
Presentation of the rather expected results that the average salary increases with the level of education, years of experience and depending on gender. There are not many deviations for the race factor (perhaps the Chinese and Hispanics are in a less desirable position). It was noted that job titles like Data Scientist, Software Engineer Manager and Project Engineer have higher average salaries even though they have fewer people in that job title.
